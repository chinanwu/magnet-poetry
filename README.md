## Upcoming Features(?)

These are things that I have in my noggin and want to implement (if I have the time...):

- The option to select word packages! Right now I just have 3000 words and I grab 100 random words from there. I'd love to, for example, have a D&D subset or something!

Note to salmon: To deploy to gh-pages `git subtree push --prefix dist origin gh-pages`
